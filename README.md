Welcome to Run Sprite Run!

I decided it was time to take my well-loved Platformer game and recreate it in C++, using everything I have learned throughout courses and self study over the past couple of years.

I am really excited to remake this game, to see what I am capable of!

You are welcome to visit for updates on how my code is going, and please reach out if you would like to connect!
